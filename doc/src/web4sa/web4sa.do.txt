======= Remaining =======

 * apply (generated apps) to simviz (make py simviz too and describe that)
 * store data in database
 * discuss list values read as text and use of eval, perhaps exercise
 * avoid Flask or Django in exercises, just do not specify and have
   common exercises at the very end
 * app: username, TextAreaField, store in database and retrieve for admin
