===== Exercise: Add two numbers =====
label{wf:exer:add2}
file=add2.tar.gz

Make a web application that reads two numbers from a web page,
adds the numbers, and prints the sum in a new web page.
Package the necessary files that constitute the application
in a tar file.



# #if TOPIC in ('Flask+Django', 'Flask')
===== Exercise: Extend the `vib3_flask` application =====
label{wf:exer:vib3:ext}
file=vib3_ext.tar.gz

Use the `label` argument in the form field objects to add an
information of the type of data that is to be supplied in the
text field. Extend the `model.py` file to also handle
lists, tuples, and Numerical Python arrays. For these three
new data types, use a `TextField` object and run `eval`
on the text in the `view.py` file.


===== Exercise: Auto-generate code from function signature =====
file=generate_flask.py

Given a `compute` with a set of positional and keyword
arguments, the purpose of this exercise is to *automatically* generate the
Flask files `model.py` and `view.py`. Use the Python `inspect`
module, see Section ref{wf:vib3:flask:autogen}, to extract
the positional and keyword arguments in `compute`, and use this
information to construct the relevant Python code. Assume as
in Section ref{wf:vib3:flask:autogen} that the user provides
a file `view_results.html` for defining how the returned object
from the `compute` function is to be rendered.

Test the code generator on the `compute` function in the `vib1_flask`
application to check that the generated
`model.py` and `view.py` files are correct.
