<!-- TITLE: Using Flask to Create Scientific Web Applications -->
<p>
<center><h4>Jun 6, 2013</h4></center> <!-- date -->

<h2>Web frameworks  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>

<p>
Computational scientists may want to offer their applications through
a web interface, thereby making a <em>web application</em>.
Basically, this means that users can set input data
to the application on a web page, then click on some <em>Compute</em> button,
and back comes a new web page with the results of the computations.
The web interface can either be used as a GUI locally on the
scientist's computer, or the interface can be depolyed to
a server and made available to the whole world.

<p>
Web applications of the mentioned type can be created from scratch
using CGI scripts in (e.g.) Python, but the code quickly gets longer
and more involved as the complexity of the web interface
grows. Nowadays, most web applications are created with the aid of
<em>web frameworks</em>, which are software packages that simplify the
programming tasks of offering services through the Internet. The
downside of web frameworks is that there is a significant amount of
steps and details to learn before your first simple demo application
works.  The upside is that advanced applications are within reach,
without an overwhelming amount of programming, as soon as you have
understood the basic demos.

<p>
We shall in the forthcoming text explore the very easy-to-use <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask framework</a>.  At the time of this writing, Flask is not
much documented beyond the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">official web site</a> and the <a href="http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/0.6/index.html">WTForms Documentation</a>. That is why we have made specific examples for the application of Flask in computational science.

<p>
The problem for a computational scientist who wants to enable
mathematical calculations through the web is that most of
the introductory examples on utilizing a particular
web framework address web applications
of very different nature, e.g., blogs and polls. Therefore, we have made an
alternative introduction which explains, in the simplest possible way,
how web frameworks can be used to

<p>

<ol>
<li> generate a web page with input data to your application,</li>
<li> run the application to perform mathematical computations, and</li>
<li> generate a web page with the results of the computations.</li>
</ol>

Flask is very easy to work with and extensive Python knowledge is
not necessary. It is in fact enough to know about functions and
modules. Beyond that, some knowledge of classes might be an advantage.
