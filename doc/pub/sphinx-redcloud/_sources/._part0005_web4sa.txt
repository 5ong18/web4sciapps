*Address already in use.* You can easily kill the Flask application and restart it, but sometimes
you will get an error that the address is already in use.
To recover from this problem, run the ``lsof`` program to see which program
that applies the 5000 port (Flask runs its server on ``http://127.0.0.1:5000``):


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> lsof -i :5000
        COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
        python  48824  hpl    3u  IPv4 1128848      0t0  TCP ...
        Terminal> kill -9 48824

The last command killed the ``python`` job that ran the test server and
you are ready to relaunch the Flask application.
