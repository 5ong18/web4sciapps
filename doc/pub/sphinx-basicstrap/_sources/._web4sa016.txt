Project 1: Using Bootstrap styles
---------------------------------

.. index::
   single: Flask; bootstrap style

The design and layout of the graphical web interface is completely
governed by template file. So far, we have used only basic HTML
elements in this file. With CSS it is possible to improve the
design, but why not adopt popular frameworks that offer an attractive
look-and-feel and much nice functionality such as responsive pages
across a wide range of devices? The `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`__
framework is free and open software that gives developers a kick start
with respect to web page design and functionality.
Many designs are built on Bootstrap: "Bootswatch": "http:bootswatch.com",
`Start Bootstrap <http://startbootstrap.com/>`__,
`Bootstrap Zero <http://bootstrapzero.com/>`__, and `PrepBootstrap <http://www.prepbootstrap.com/>`__.

It would obviously be advantageous to create Flask templates that
can utilize the Bootstrap technology. A package `Flask-Bootstrap <http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/>`__
is already supporting this idea.


.. admonition:: Project

     * Test out the Flask-Bootstrap package by redoing a selection
       of the previous examples with the Bootstrap design and functionality.
   
     * How easy is it to take advantage of various Bootstrap designs,
       say the Bootswatch themes, in a template based on Flask-Bootstrap?
   
     * Make a new GUI [#app]_ with different types of input fields and see how
       the design looks like in Bootstrap-based themes:
   
        * one selection from a list (radio buttons, drop-down list)
   
        * multiple selections from a list (check buttons)
   
        * one-line text field
   
        * multi-line text field
   
        * floating-point number
   
        * integer




.. [#app] The compute function can be very simple, e.g., just returning some HTML
   typesetting of the arguments. This subexercise is for test purposes
   only.
