Remaining
=========

 * apply (generated apps) to simviz (make py simviz too and describe that)

 * store data in database

 * discuss list values read as text and use of eval, perhaps exercise

 * avoid Flask or Django in exercises, just do not specify and have
   common exercises at the very end

 * app: username, TextAreaField, store in database and retrieve for admin
