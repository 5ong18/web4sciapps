**Address already in use.**
You can easily kill the Flask application and restart it, but sometimes
you will get an error that the address is already in use.
To recover from this problem, run the ``lsof`` program to see which program
that applies the 5000 port (Flask runs its server on ``http://127.0.0.1:5000``,
which means that it uses the 5000 port). Find the PID of the program
that occupies the port and force abortion of that program:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> lsof -i :5000
        COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
        python  48824  hpl    3u  IPv4 1128848      0t0  TCP ...
        Terminal> kill -9 48824

You are now ready to restart a Flask application.
