Exercise 1: Add two numbers
---------------------------

Make a web application that reads two numbers from a web page,
adds the numbers, and prints the sum in a new web page.
Package the necessary files that constitute the application
in a tar file.
Filename: ``add2.tar.gz``.

Exercise 2: Extend the ``vib3_flask`` app
-----------------------------------------

Add a new argument ``x_axis`` to the ``compute`` function in the
`vib_flask3 <https://github.com/hplgit/web4sciapps/tree/master/doc/src/web4sa/vib_flask3>`__ application from the section :ref:`wf:vib3:flask:autogen`. The ``x_axis`` argument measures the extent
of the :math:`x` axis in the plots in terms of the number of standard
deviations (default may be 7).  Observe how the web interface
automatically adds the new argument and how the plots adapt!

Exercise 3: Equip the ``vib3_flask`` app with more data types
-------------------------------------------------------------

In the `vib_flask3 <https://github.com/hplgit/web4sciapps/tree/master/doc/src/web4sa/vib_flask3>`__
application from the section :ref:`wf:vib3:flask:autogen`,
use the ``label`` argument in the form field objects to add an
information of the type of data that is to be supplied in the
text field. Extend the ``model.py`` file to also handle
lists, tuples, and Numerical Python arrays. For these three
new data types, use a ``TextField`` object and run ``eval``
on the text in the ``view.py`` file.
A simple test is to extend the ``compute`` function with an
argument ``x_range`` for the range of the :math:`x` axis, specified as
an interval (2-list or 2-tuple).
Filename: ``vib3_ext.tar.gz``.

Exercise 4: Auto-generate code from function signature
------------------------------------------------------

Given a ``compute`` with a set of positional and keyword
arguments, the purpose of this exercise is to *automatically* generate the
Flask files ``model.py`` and ``view.py``. Use the Python ``inspect``
module, see the section :ref:`wf:vib3:flask:autogen`, to extract
the positional and keyword arguments in ``compute``, and use this
information to construct the relevant Python code. Assume as
in the section :ref:`wf:vib3:flask:autogen` that the user provides
a file ``view_results.html`` for defining how the returned object
from the ``compute`` function is to be rendered.

Test the code generator on the ``compute`` function in the ``vib1_flask``
application to check that the generated
``model.py`` and ``view.py`` files are correct.
Filename: ``generate_flask.py``.

Remaining
=========

 * apply (generated apps) to simviz (make py simviz too and describe that)

 * store data in database

 * discuss list values read as text and use of eval, perhaps exercise

 * avoid Flask or Django in exercises, just do not specify and have
   common exercises at the very end

 * app: username, TextAreaField, store in database and retrieve for admin
